A process is an algorithm, a list of steps and if we turn this algorithm into code we create a function.

For computers, we need to be very specific about each step of the logical chain for desired results.

The function will always have a name either variable that holds the function or function itself.
it will always have parameters.
There always be culy brackets wrapping around the function body.
And some functions may return data back where the function called.
