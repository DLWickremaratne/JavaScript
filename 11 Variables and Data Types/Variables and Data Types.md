Refer to some piese of data we first create a container calles variable and set its contents using the equals symble.

#var
The classic variable container in JavaScript is simply called var,
it is also the default if we forget.

VAR is defined as a globally scoped variable
first assign value to have VAR and then inside a function,assign new value
that new value inside the function takes effect.
even outside the function

For this reason two new types of variable,
Let
Scope

When you want to use a changable or mutable variable you should use a let.
var only really usefull if you want a mutable variable with globle scope all the time.

#Const
once define you cannot assign a new value to it.
Any data that should be protected from accidentally being overwritten like an object or an array or a function ,
use a const.

#Assignment vs comparison

Equal symble means assigment.
The value on the right side is assigned to the container on the left.

Also use equal symbols for comparison.
Are the Values the same but not absolutelt the same.

    a==b
    a===b
    a<b
    a!b
